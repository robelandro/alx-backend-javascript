### ðŸ““ what is ES6?

ES6 is short for ECMAScript 6, which is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. ES6 was released in 2015 and introduced many new features to JavaScript, such as arrow functions, spread operator, for/of loop, map objects, classes, promises, etc23. ES6 makes working with JavaScript easier and more readable.

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts ES6 code into ES5 code. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. It can convert let and const declarations to var, arrow functions to ES5 functions, classes to ES5 constructors, and so on. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts ES6 code into ES5 code.
